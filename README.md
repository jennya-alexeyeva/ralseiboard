# Ralseiboard
Ralsei and Jennya's Discord Dashboard

Dashboard plans:
- Leaderboard for each channel (and overall) to show who's sent the most messages
- Track how  many messages are sent on what days of the week and at what times (maybe in what specific channels)
- Page for each user showing what times and what channels they're the most active in
- Who knows?

Current commands:
- /hug: hug Ralsei
- /random image: get a random Ralsei image
- /random gif: get a random Ralsei gif
- /random meme: get a random Ralsei meme
- /textbox: queries the [Undertale Text Box Generator](https://www.demirramon.com/generators/undertale_text_box_generator) to make Ralsei say what you want
- /yummycakes: Ralsei will offer you some yummy cakes
- /init: initializes the database

Coming soon:
- fast commands from the database (ex. top 5 channels, most active day, most active time)
- webapp built based on database
