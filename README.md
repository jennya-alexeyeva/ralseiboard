# Ralseiboard
Ralsei and Jennya's Discord Dashboard

Dashboard plans:
- Leaderboard for each channel (and overall) to show who's sent the most messages
- Track how  many messages are sent on what days of the week and at what times (maybe in what specific channels)
- Page for each user showing what times and what channels they're the most active in
- Who knows?

Non-dashboard plans:
- /hug command that makes Ralsei respond happily
- /image sends a random Ralsei image
- /gif sends a random Ralsei gif
- /textbox queries the [Undertale Text Box Generator](https://www.demirramon.com/generators/undertale_text_box_generator) and generates a Ralsei text box based on parameters
    - this will be hard!
- /dashboard sends a link to the dashboard
    - look into how to generate a new one for each server (for now though how to get one link lmaoooo)
