- each server has its own database
- this database is created when sweet ralsei joins a server and deleted when he leaves
- each database has two tables: messages and settings

Messages table:
- stores for each message (probably inefficient but i don't know another way lmao):
-- message ID (primary key)
-- day of the week it was sent (indexed 0 for sunday through 6 for saturday)
-- time of the day it was sent (as the beginning of the hour in military time)
-- channel ID it was sent in
-- author of the message

Settings table:
- could just be config file lmao - think abt this
- stores settings such as admin role, preferences (brainstorm this) (maybe primary timezone?), etc

possibly other tables w/secondary keys or whatever tf they're called to minimize loading time
